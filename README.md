# Assignment 2: GitHub Basics & Collaboration 

## Task Overview
This assignment demonstrates how to push local changes to a GitHub repository, create new branches for features, make changes, and merge pull requests while practicing GitHub Flow.

## Steps Completed

### 1. *Pushed Local Repository (Assignment 1) to GitHub*
- Initially, I pushed the local repository from *Assignment 1* to the newly created GitHub repository. This step involved connecting the local repository to GitHub and ensuring that the main branch was up-to-date.

### 2. *Created a New Branch Locally*
- I created a new feature branch locally to implement changes for the repository. This branch was named feature/update-readme to make updates to the README.md file and reflect the changes made during the assignment.

### 3. *Pushed the New Branch to GitHub*
- The new feature branch, feature/update-readme, was pushed to the GitHub repository. This step made the changes available on GitHub for review and merging.

### 4. *Created a Pull Request on GitHub*
- A pull request was created from the feature/update-readme branch to the main branch on GitHub. This pull request contained all the changes made to the README.md file.

### 5. *Reviewed and Merged the Pull Request*
- After reviewing the pull request, it was successfully merged into the main branch on GitHub. This step completed the task of updating the main repository with the changes made in the feature branch.

### 6. *Pulled Changes and Synced Locally*
- After merging the pull request on GitHub, I pulled the changes into the local repository to ensure that the local branch was synchronized with the remote main branch.

## Summary:
- The *main branch* now contains the updated *README.md* with task details.
- The *feature/update-readme* branch was created to update the README, and a pull request was successfully created, reviewed, and merged into the main branch.
- This workflow reinforced concepts such as branching, committing, pull requests, and merging, which are key components of GitHub's collaborative features.
